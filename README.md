# SQL Injection semi-automatic tool

This repository provides a semi-automatic tool to exploit an SQL Injection. It does not help you for finding it you have to provide the correct SQL queries yourself. Therefore, this tool is RDBMS agnostic.

It allows you to have a fine control on the requests you send, espacially if you want to minimize side effects in order to have a silent attack.

You have an example of how to use it in the script `main.py`. This tool has been tested on the [Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)](https://github.com/digininja/DVWA).

## Disclaimer

You shall not misuse this tool to gain unauthorised access. Performing hack attempts (without permission) on computers that you do not own is illegal.
